			so I made this from scratch i promise just took the art and wordList from
			someone. I am practicing my JS skills. this Hangman has words from Bible
			(not a christian). The reason is i like the stories told in this book . I
			wish i could make it even better .

		<p style="background-color: bisque">
			hangman is a simple game i made it in python ,then rust ,then C , but was
			not satisfied . So gave it another go and made again . JS HTML CSS could
			be to powerful sometimes. Because you need basic html css then a little
			bit of DOM . Then make whatever pleases you .
